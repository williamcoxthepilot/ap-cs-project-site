      <h2>Paper Rocket</h2>
      <p>For this project, we had to make a paper rocket that would go the highest, starting with regular paper and making modifications so we could put electronics in it and to make the nose stronger. We used Whitebox to teach us about the process of making these rockets
        but mainly the aspects we need to pay attention to and change, like stability. We decided to make our entire rocket 3d printed to see if that could beat the lightweight alternative of paper, but we ran into many problems but below is an image of the first version we tried.

      <p>What we did to improve our design was in part the production of our design, how we were 3d printing it but also the design. The big thing that stands out on our rocket are the fins, which are set up with the goal of making the rocket spin which should have made it more stable.
        It helped, but the overall weight of the rocket was a problem, but also it was not sealed good because 3d printed things are not airtight, so our rocket lost power but even when going up the stability was not good and it would flip around as it reached appogee and on the way back down.
        The data was mostly accurate and we could have changed our designt to be paper but if we stuck with the 3d printed one, we should have found a way to make it airtight but to also make it more stable. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1kD-aw3hHzHnbb3rVTCviEaiqP1N0Tz92tfPZ2eu8IxM/edit?usp=sharing">Link</a> to data spreadsheet.</p>

      </div>
      <p>For this project, we were upgrading the kidwind turbine that was given to us and I designed the blades, the nose cone and also a small part that holds the gear offset from the
        driving gear. I learned how to use a software called qblade and in the process I learned about some other types of data used to test blades but also the entire process of choosing what would work best.
        I also learned a lot about gearing as I helped getting the gearbox working, and some challenges we faced was the design led to a lot of parts shifting and moving leading to the gears not meshing.
        Our performance was not good as we tested it at Cal Maritime and for our first attempt the gears failed and didn't mesh but also due to our design the blades were very close to hitting the roof
        but also it had shifted and the blades were hitting the wind turbine so we got nothing out of our first attempt. For our second try, we got it moving but it was very slow and when we sped up the wind speed,
        the blades started to hit the roof. We were unable to try for a third time after we made some more modifications to it that likely made it better, but we ran out of time and in the end,
        we made about 1J of energy which is averaged across 30 seconds.

      <h2>Bridge Project</h2>
      <h3>Bridge V1</h3>

      </div>
      <p>This is the first part of this assigment which is to make the first version of a bridge that we tested. We had size limitations on making this bridge as it could only be a max of 400mm and we had to build it out of cardboard that was available.
        We were limited in the materials we could use to help like tape or wood support or anything much, we could use string and cardboard screws and the bridge had to be able to fit two small cars on it. The way we assembled it was by putting slots into the top and bottom,
      and putting holes that fit into those slots on the trusses. Our bridge had a weight of about 30g and supported about 6.8kg.</p>
        <div id="multiimg">

          <img src="img/bridgev1bottomcad.png" alt="Cad drawing of the bottom" class="images">
        </div>
      <p>Overall, the bridge was very strong and the weight of it was a huge point to making it so efficient, and the design was quick and easy to assemble while being strong. The changes we need to do is making the bridge longer because it was on the very edge of the table
        and that was the first thing to fail as the ends of the bridge just bent in once we put enough weight in. We also need to possibly use double ply on the trusses for more strength and make the edge of the trusses strong by getting rid of the holes or make them thicker.

        <p>For this assignment, I had to make a train from the drawings that were provided to me. There were 9 parts that had to be built and a few of them were difficult considering
          that not all dimensions were provided so it really required me to make the sketches fully constrained. This advanced my knowledge of fusion and allowed me to make an actual project, not just a random object for practice.
          I also learned new techniques that are faster and easier when making odd shapped objects like the wheel and cow catcher.</p>
