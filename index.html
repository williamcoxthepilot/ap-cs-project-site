      <p>For my final genius hour, I partnered with my classmate to make an electric guitar with out 3d printers. We had a few goals for this project, mainly to create a 3d printed guitar that is cost effective for us but to also be functional and look good. If we had more time, I believe we could have tried 
        to add effects to the guitar or possibly add an amp onto the guitar for easy movement. For the parts, we printed the entire body and some other parts needed on the guitar, but we had to buy things like electronics and tuners as we were not going to be able to make those things on our own as well as the neck 
        because the neck needs to be precise and we don't have much experience woodworking. For all the parts, we were able to get all the parts for around $80 if we don't include filament costs. It took some time to get those parts to fit on our own 3d printed parts and it required a lot of modification to make it work.
        I learned through this project how to print with petg, but I also learned how to wire the guitar and do a more in depth setup on it, but mainly just building this from scratch and modifing it to work. Another cool thing we did was lasering the headstock as a final customization which adds a lot to the build.

      <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/737789733" id="brawlerscratch"> Brawler Game</a></h2>
      <p>The project was to make a game based on our chosen genre, and we chose a brawler game. Our main goal was to get
        the skins and fighting mechanics working so that it was a functional and fun game to play on the arcade machine.
        We did have a few challenges, such as small bugs that came up when we would add something new to the game. I
        learned a lot about coding and getting a game to have full functionality.</p>

      <h2><a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/898529023"> Drawing app</a></h2>
      <p>In the drawing app, the goal was to make an application that could draw different shapes based on the desired
        amount of sides. More and more goals were added throughout the project that gave even more work, but in the end
        it added a lot more functionality and usability. I really learned how much math could be used in a simple
        program like this, a program that people might use and think how simple it is, but in reality it is a lot more
        complex than it may seem.</p>

      <h2>Personal project</h2>
      <p>I found a great interest in making a functional radio, so I bought my own radio kit off of amazon and put it
        together. The main goal was to obtain a functional radio with an alarm and could tune in to FM radio
        frequencies. I feel the main challenge was getting the battery terminals set up because they had a very hard
        time fitting into the body of the radio and getting the thin wires soldered onto the battery terminals was not
        easy. I learned a lot about how radios actually work and how they can tune into a radio frequency.</p>

      <p>For my fall genius hour I decided to optimize the free to use pcb development website easyeda to make my own pcb.
      I decided to make a blinking light circuit using a 555 timer integrated circuit. I have a power source that supplies power to the board, 
      three resistors in order to protect the leds from getting too much current. In the end, I really did this project to learn how to use a simple ic with a simple
      pcb board to learn the basics of electrical egineering.

        For my ap create project I decided to make a password manager that can store a users passwords but to also remove and find their passwords.
        The hardest part of this project was being able to figure out how to use the built in json package in python and finding out how to create a json file
        and store those passwords. The main method I used was converting the json file into a python dictionary, then either adding to that dictionary, deleting something
        at a specific property name, or finding something as a property name and then converts it back to the json file with the new dictionary.

        For this project we used a pi pico which is a mini computer to control a neopixel strip of light. Our goal was to create a functioning stop light
        that simulates what a stop light would do in terms of light order. We used thonny as the IDE to write our code to the pico which would set the light
        and wait 3 seconds before changing it to something else.

        For my spring genius hour I worked on a timer that would stop when a robot or ball passes a laser. I made the stand that held the computer,
        two seven segments one for displaying the time and the other to display the resistance value of the photoresistor that is getting shot by the laser.
        I used an ethernet cable to wire the laser and the photoresistor and this allowed me to move and separate the laser system from the main computer.
